# visual-regression-demo
Running automated tests using visual regression services in Webdriver.io

Reference and screen images are based on the screen/monitor used. 
If running tests on a different screen, delete the screenshots folder first, then run the tests to get the reference images. 
Then run the tests whenever required, on the same screen.
